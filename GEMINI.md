# Project Context: Energy Based Neural Net

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a **predictive coding model** using an energy-based neural network approach. 
The repository is currently in the initial scaffolding phase.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python (>= 3.10)
- **Dependency Management:** `uv`
- **Linting:** `ruff`

## Directory Structure
- `src/`: Source code directory (currently empty).
- `pyproject.toml`: Configuration for dependencies and tools.
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md`: Intended for project roadmap and task tracking.
- `.venv/`: Virtual environment.

## Development Workflow

### Setup
The project uses `uv` for dependency management.
```bash
uv sync
```

### Running Tests
*No tests established yet.*

### Linting
The project uses `ruff`.
```bash
ruff check .
```
